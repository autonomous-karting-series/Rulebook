# Mechanical Rules

These rules are open to interpretation where specifics are not given. This means that, for example, a material is not explicitly stated then that material is not banned as long as it does not break another rule in this section. Other sections may have specificities for those areas.

## Frame / Chassis

 1. Any Commercial Full Size "Sprint Kart" chassis may be used
 2. Custom Built Kart chassis may be built provided they utilize standard Off-the-Shelf Components.
    1. Off-the-Shelf Components can be defined as a part that is purchased from a Go-Kart parts provider.
    2. Examples of Off-the-Shelf components may contain but are not limited to:
      * Tie Rods
      * Brake Calipers
      * Wheel Hubs
    3. Any custom fabricated parts must have accompanying CAD models as well as relevant stress calculations.
    4. Custom Chassis wheelbase must be representative to the wheelbase of Commercial Chassis. **_If there is concern please contact the competition organizer._**
 3. All Chassis components must be documented on a Bill of Materials (BOM) declaring the part number and supplier.
    1. For Custom Chassis the BOM must be broken down by fabricated parts.
 4. All Chassis must include mounting points for Front and Rear bumpers.
