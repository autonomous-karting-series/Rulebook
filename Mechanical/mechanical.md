## Disclaimer

These rules are open to interpretation where specifics are not given. This means that, for example, a material is not explicitly stated then that material is not banned as long as it does not break another rule in this section. Other sections may have specificities for those areas.

## Frame / Chassis

 1. Any Commercial Full Size "Sprint Kart" chassis may be used
 2. Custom Built Kart chassis may be built provided they utilize standard Off-the-Shelf Components.
    1. Off-the-Shelf Components can be defined as a part that is purchased from a Go-Kart parts provider.
    2. Examples of Off-the-Shelf components may contain but are not limited to:
      * Tie Rods
      * Brake Calipers
      * Wheel Hubs
    3. Any custom fabricated parts must have accompanying CAD models as well as relevant stress calculations.
    4. Custom Chassis wheelbase must be representative to the wheelbase of Commercial Chassis. **_If there is concern please contact the competition organizer._**
 3. All Chassis components must be documented on a BOM declaring the part number and supplier.
    1. For Custom Chassis the BOM must be broken down by fabricated parts.
 4. All Chassis must include mounting points for Front and Rear bumpers.

## Tires

 1. All teams must use the following tire sizes:
    * Front Tires - 10 x 4.50-5
    * Rear Tires - 11 x 7.10-5
 2. All teams must use the following compounds of slick tires:
    * Hoosier R60B
    * _Alternative brands and compounds must be requested for evaluation and if approved this section of the rules will be amended._
 3. All teams must have the Wheel or Wheel Hub mounted to the chassis with a __Castle Nut and Cotter Pin__ or with a __Locking Nut and Safety Wire__.
 4. If teams choose to use Wheel Hubs then the tires must be secured to the Wheel Hub with a __Locking Nut__. Safety Wires are not required.

## Brakes

 1. All teams must at minimum have brakes on both rear tires.
    * A rear axle with 1 brake assembly attached will count for both rear tires.
 2. Teams are encouraged to have brakes on all 4 wheels of the kart.
 3. Teams must be able to lock the brakes on any wheel with a brake attached.
    * This will be enforced by having the kart accelerate over a given distance and then the team must brake as much as needed to lock the brakes.
    * _At this time there is no maximum stopping distance._
 4. All hydraulic brake lines must be braided lines with the appropriate fittings to prevent leaks.

## Weight

 1. There is no maximum weight.
 2. There is a minimum weight of 250 pounds with all components attached to the kart.

## Mounting

 1. Any component mounted directly to the chassis not mentioned already must be secured with a threadlocker.
    1. Components that are needed to be removed and remounted frequently may be secured with a __Locking Nut__.
    2. Electrical wires may be secured with cable ties or similar items.
 2. __Internally Mounted Components__ must be securely mounted such that the components do not become detached or loose inside their container.
 3. The above mounting rules are enforcable through visual inspection with physical inspections if there is concern.

## Materials

 1. Any non-Internally Mounted Component must not be subject to the following:
    * Acrylic
    * Any __Brittle Material__

## BOM (Bill of Materials)

 1. Teams must provide a Bill of Materials for all mechanical components __NOT__ mounted internally.
    1. Each mechanical component must be represented by an individual section in the BOM.
 2. A Team's Mechanical BOM cost shall not exceed $10,000 USD.
    * A team is able to estimate the cost of a component if it is unsure of the total value of the component. _This must be stated if the cost is estimated_.
