## Spirit of the Competition

The goal of the Autonomous Karting Series is to create an accessible and exciting autonomous go kart race. The race presents a realistic scenario in which teams need to build go-karts that will race and compete on a track autonomously. It is encouraged that teams will work to create innovative and performant hardware, electrical, and software solutions.

## Event Structure

 1. There will be multiple Official Practice Sessions throughout a race event and a Official Race Session.
    1. Official Practice sessions will follow competition safety rules as if the practice session was a Race Session.
    2. Official Race Session will be 1 kart running on the track at a time.
 2. Team rankings will be by total time taken to complete the 5 laps.
 3. The team order in which each category will be run will be decided in order of fastest laps ran during official practice sessions.

## Race Track Definition

 1. The track is defined by the paved surface of the track
    * Individual races may have extra/special features to define the track.
 2. Track width must be at minimum 15 feet.
 3. The start/finish line will be identified on a per track basis.

## Allowed Data During Race

 1. ALL data collected during the Official Practice Sessions is allowed during the Race Session.
 2. ALL data must be collected using the go-kart competing.
    1. Data collected using a secondary vehicle is not allowed.
 3. A non-encompassing list of allowed data:
       * GPS waypoints
       * Track centerline
       * Track edges
       * Track images
       * Track pointcloud
 4. Teams are encouraged to not focus entirely on a predefined run of the track but also take into account track conditions and adapt.
    * This will lead into full multi-kart races.

## Multi-Kart Exposition Runs

 1. During the event, there may be 1 or more exposition runs where 2 will be incentivized to showcase multi-kart racing capabilities under fully autonomous conditions.

## Awards

 1. Fastest Time Awards
    * The top 3 teams will receive placement awards in order of Race Total Time.
 2. Engineering Excellence Award
    * The awarded team will be selected from judges based on design documents and implementation of components on the kart.
