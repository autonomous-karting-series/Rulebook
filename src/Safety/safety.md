## Required Safety Components

 1. __Remote Estop__ must be tied to at minimum a physical controller.
    1. Off the shelf Emergency Stop systems are allowed as long as they do not interfere with the track and has a physical trigger.
 2. __Remote Estop__ that when triggered does the following:
    1. Apply the brakes bringing the kart to a full stop.
    2. Disconnect power to the __Drivetrain__.
 3. __Physical Estop__ that is clearly labelled and cuts all power to the kart.

 6. There must be no exposed sharp edges on the kart.
 7. Front and Rear bumpers are required.
    1. Bumpers cannot be custom made and must be purchased.

## Remote Control

 2. Remote Control is needed to drive around other teams that may be on track during practice.
    1. __Autonomous Driving__ around teams is not allowed when people are on track.
 3. The Remote Control Driving Controller must always have a __Deadman Switch__ in order for the kart to be driving.
 4. The __Remote Estop__ controller is required to reach at minimum 200 meters line of sight to the kart.
