## Frame / Chassis

 1. Any Commercial Full Size "Sprint Kart" chassis may be used
    * Custom Chassis may not be built from scratch.
 3. All Chassis components must be documented on a BOM declaring the part number and supplier.
    1. For Custom Chassis the BOM must be broken down by fabricated parts.
 4. All Chassis must include mounting points for Front and Rear bumpers.

## Tires

 1. Go-Karts must use the following tire sizes:
    * Front Tires - 10 x 4.50-5
    * Rear Tires - 11 x 7.10-5
 2. Go-Karts must use the following compounds of slick tires:
    * Hoosier R60B
    * Vega XH3 Green (Hard Compound)
    * Vega XM3 White (Medium Compound)
    * _Other tires may be allowed as long as they are of similar durometer to the above compounds. Please contact competition organizers for clarification on allowable tire compounds._
 3. Go-Karts must have the Front Wheels or Wheel Hubs mounted to the spindle with a __Castle Nut and Cotter Pin__ or with a __Locking Nut and Safety Wire__.
 4. If teams choose to use Wheel Hubs then the tires must be secured to the Wheel Hub with a __Locking Nut__. Safety Wires are not required.

## Brakes

 1. Go-Karts must at minimum have brakes on both rear tires.
    * A rear axle with 1 brake assembly attached will count for both rear tires.
 2. Teams are encouraged to have brakes on all 4 wheels of the kart.
 3. All hydraulic brake lines must be braided lines with the appropriate fittings to prevent leaks.

## Weight

 1. There is no maximum weight.
 2. There is a minimum weight of 300 pounds with all components attached to the kart.
    * It is advised that teams use corner scales to balance their Go-Kart. Common Go-Kart weight distribution is provided below.
      * Front to Back -> 43% to 57%
      * Left to Right -> 50% to 50%

## Mounting

 1. Any component mounted directly to the chassis not mentioned already must be secured with a threadlocker.
    1. Components that are needed to be removed and remounted frequently may be secured with a __Locking Nut__.
    2. Electrical wires may be secured with cable ties or similar items.
 2. __Internally Mounted Components__ must be securely mounted such that the components do not become detached or loose inside their container.
 3. The above mounting rules are enforcable through visual inspection with physical inspections if there is concern.

## Materials

 1. Any non-Internally Mounted Component must not be subject to the following:
    * Acrylic
    * Any __Brittle Material__

## BOM (Bill of Materials)

 1. Teams must provide a Bill of Materials for all mechanical components __NOT__ mounted internally.
    1. Each mechanical component must be represented by an individual section in the BOM.
 2. A Team's Mechanical BOM cost shall not exceed $10,000 USD.
    * A team is able to estimate the cost of a component if it is unsure of the total value of the component. _This must be stated if the cost is estimated_.
